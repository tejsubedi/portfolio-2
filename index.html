                    enrolled
                    in UofT Bootcamp to enhance hands on experience in skills as well knowledge for 3 months.
                    I have been learning multi project based technical programming skills <em><strong>(web and
                            mobile

                    With significant understanding of IT implications, and previous multi-sector working
                    knowledge,
                    lead to find solutions to the global challenges that lie ahead and approaches to corporate
                    strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. I am
